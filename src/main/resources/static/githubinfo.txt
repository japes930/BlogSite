GitHub is a graphical interface for the Git, an online repository application with version control functionality. It also has social network features.

It is an open-source so you can browse other GitHub users’ projects, get a copy for yourself to “play around”. Of course, other users can do the same with your public projects. Either way, the original project is safe.

Best part about the GitHub is that you and your co-workers can work on the same project without worrying about version control.
